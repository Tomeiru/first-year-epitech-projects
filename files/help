Hey! Welcome to my hunter!

The goal of the game is simple!

You need to get the higher score possible before losing.

To raise your score, you need to kill birds, each bird has a different speed and a different worth.
    Pink => 1 point
    Black => 2 points
    Red => 3 points

To prevent a game over, you need to kill at least five birds per round!

A round is 10 bird, you kill a bird by pressing left click over a bird and you miss by missing your shot or letting a bird escape.

Good luck and have fun!
