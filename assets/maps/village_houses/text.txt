Wait, WHAT?
*MY PIE! NO!
*Oh no no no, the contest will start soon.
I need to bake a new pie!
*There should be floud somewhere in the market.
There are berries in the forest.
However, for the sugar, I guess I need to ask to the witch.
*Well, I should hurry.
I should put these shoes, I need to run.
*You found a knife.
*Take those healing potions, you will need it.
*Good luck.

Ziska deux yeux su la bec un canard ti marmaille.
Amen.
*You found a sock.
*There is nothing here.
*Woaf woaf!
