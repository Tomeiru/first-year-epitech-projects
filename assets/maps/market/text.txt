*Hey Helga. How are you doing?
*What?! You don't have a pie anymore?
Well that's annoying...
*Take my eggs, you'll surely need them more than me.
*STOP !
It's dangerous to go alone! You'll need a sword, or a knife at least.
*You want a sword?
It's only 25.90$!
*How could I have forgotten my sock at home...?
*My sock! Thank you.
I'll trade it for this apple.
*Ugh I'm so hungry...
*AN APPLE! Here have this.
*Damn, what do I do? My tool is broken.
*Oh, a scythe! I'll buy it from you with this shiny thing.
I don't really know what it does, it shines bright in the night though.
*There's nothing but worthless junk here.
*Ooh, that shiny object you're holding!
Let's trade, here's this high tech object that comes from very far away.
*I'm bored.
*Is that for me? Is it???
Take this, I wanted to eat it but it's got eyes so I'm kind of creeped out.
*I want to make a mushroom casserole...
*That's a nice mushroom, here, I'll trade it for some of my flour.
